# Fashion MNIST GAN

This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating Fashion MNIST data. Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images, consisting of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples of 10 different clothing types.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through adversarial training.

In this project, we use a GAN to generate synthetic images that resemble the Fashion MNIST dataset. The generator network learns to generate realistic images of clothing items, while the discriminator network learns to distinguish between real and generated images.
